fastbit collector
=================

### issues
No known issues at this time.

### overview
This program sits on a network that has a broadcasting statistics server, collects all broadcasted zone packets and saves them into zone-specific tables. It can listen for ZMQ SUBscribe-able traffic on any port and IP. Its database is configurable by the `gz.conf` and `ngz.conf` files (loaded at runtime) located in the same directory as the executable.

It is designed to be run in any non-global zone on SmartOS systems; however, with a bit of reconfiguration it can be made to run in GZ. It is meant to be run continuously.

#### usage
```bash
  listener [-h] [-v] [-p NUMBER] [-a ADDR] [-d DELAY]
     -h         prints this help/usage page
     -v         run in verbose mode (print all queries and ZMQ packets)
     -p PORT    use port PORT
     -a ADDR    listen to IP address ADDR
     -d DELAY   how many packets to wait before printing ALIVE message
```

### run

###### Configuration
Running `make rel` should generate a binary called `listener` and move it into the `./bin/`. Before running, you might want to edit the two configuration files that define the way the FastBit databases are set up and saved.

Two configuration files come with this distribution, `gz.conf` and `ngz.conf`, detailing the configurations for the global and non-global zones, respectively.

The general format of the configuration file is as follows:
```
$DB_DIRECTORY
./db
$SAVE_RATE
3600

$GEN
repeats
number_of_values
value1:type1
value2:type2
value3:type3
value4:type4
value5:type5

$GROUP
...

```

`$DB_DIRECTORY` specifies the path to the save folder. Its default is `./db`, which means that by default the database will be saved into a directory called `db` within the `bin` directory.

`$SAVE_RATE` specifies the number of seconds between database saves. Its default is 3600, which means that the database is saved (and wiped) once per hour by default.

The following groups `$GROUP` represent segments of code within in the `fastbit.hpp` header. The first number following the group name is the number of times the group is repeated. For example, if you are monitoring 3 network devices in the global zone, you would set this number to `3` in the `gz.conf` file. The second number is simiply a count of the number of values to be saved for that group. In the case above, this number would be 5.

Following is a list of data columns and their respective types, separated by colons. Allowed types are
* TEXT
* ULONG
* UINT

Any additions to existing groups (assuming numbers are properly updated) will be automatically reflected in the database. New groups require new code to be written.

###### Running
* normal
* screen
