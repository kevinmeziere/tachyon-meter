fastbit collector
=================

### issues
No known issues at this time.

### overview
This program sits on a network that has a broadcasting statistics server, collects all broadcasted zone packets and saves them into zone-specific tables. It can listen for ZMQ SUBscribe-able traffic on any port and IP. Its database is configurable by the `gz.conf` and `ngz.conf` files (loaded at runtime) located in the same directory as the executable.

It is designed to be run in any non-global zone on SmartOS systems. It is meant to be run continuously.

#### usage
```bash
  listener [-h] [-v] [-p NUMBER] [-a ADDR] [-d DELAY]
     -h         prints this help/usage page
     -v         run in verbose mode (print all queries and ZMQ packets)
     -p PORT    use port PORT
     -a ADDR    listen to IP address ADDR
     -d DELAY   how many packets to wait before printing ALIVE message
```
