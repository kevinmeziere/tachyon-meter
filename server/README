 This directory contains the most current release source
 and binary for the dtrace+kstat server (C++ version).


 Dependencies for build from scratch include:

  libdtrace (native on SmartOS)
  libkstat  (native on SmartOS)
  libprotobuf - Google's Protocol Buffers
    latest release from: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
    v2.5.0 used to build code in this directory
  libzmq - Zero MQ 
    latest release from: http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software
    v2.2.0 used to build code in this directory
  libfastbit - FastBit (ibis)
    latest release from: https://codeforge.lbl.gov/frs/?group_id=44
    v1.3.5 used to build code in this directory


 As an alternative to the "COMPILE WITH:" instructions above, use the
 included Makefile by running `make'. To compile only the protocol buffer,
 run `make proto.pb.cc'. To compile only the server, run `make server'. Running
 `make clean' removes previous build of the software.

 The server defaults to using port 7211.


 BINARY USAGE (built on SmartOS):

  server_release [-h] [-p NUMBER] [-v] [-vlite]

    -h          prints help/usage page
    -p NUMBER   run on port NUMBER
    -v          runs in verbose mode (print all queries and responses/ZMQ packet)
    -vlite      print time (and dtrace ticks (tick-4999)) for each sent message
    -q          quiet mode, prints diagnostic information and does not send messages
