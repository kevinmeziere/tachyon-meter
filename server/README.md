dtrace / kstat server
=====================

issues
------
No known issues at this time.

overview
--------
This program acts as a simple server that collects machine statistics from Solaris's "kstat" (Kernal STATistics) and custom DTrace scripts, wraps them in a custom protobuf format, and then publishes them on any user-specified port using the ZMQ PUBlish method.

It is written to run in the global zone of SmartOS systems and collects/sorts gathered statistics by zone.

### USAGE
```bash
  server [-h] [-p PORT] [-v] [-vlite] [-d DELAY] -q
     -h         prints this help/usage page
     -p PORT    use port PORT
     -v         run in verbose mode (print all queries and ZMQ packets)
     -vlite     prints time (and dtrace ticks (tick-4999)) for each sent message
     -d DELAY   wait DELAY<1000 ms instead of default 1000
     -q         quiet mode, prints diagnostic information and does not send messages
```


download & build
----------------
We shall assume you are starting from scratch; therefore, all instructions are included. Omit steps according to necessity.

You'll need **git**, first of all. You can get it with 
```bash
pkgin install scmgit-base
```

You will also need the [**gcc**](http://gcc.gnu.org/) compiler, which depending on your image version can be installed with
```bash
pkgin install gcc47-4.7.2nb3 gmake
```
or
```bash
pkgin install gcc47-4.7.2 gmake
```


This program relies on several external libraries for interfacing with the network: the [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) network socket library, and Google's [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview).

### Ã˜MQ
```bash
curl -klO http://download.zeromq.org/zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
tar zxf zeromq-2.2.0.tar.gz
cd zeromq-2.2.0
./configure --prefix /opt/local
make
make install
```

### Protocol Buffers
```bash
curl -klO https://protobuf.googlecode.com/files/protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
tar zxvf protobuf-2.5.0.tar.gz
cd protobuf-2.5.0
./configure --prefix /opt/local
make
make install
```

Note that the above two libraries are configured to install into your `/opt/local` directory, which will by default install `include` and `lib` into `/opt/local/include` and `/opt/local/lib` repsectively. The rest of the build structure of the program assumes the associated libraries and include files are stored in these locations.

 This directory contains the most current release source
 and binary for the dtrace+kstat server (C++ version).


 Dependencies for build from scratch include:

  libdtrace (native on SmartOS)
  libkstat  (native on SmartOS)
  libprotobuf - Google's Protocol Buffers
    latest release from: https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/downloads/list
    v2.5.0 used to build code in this directory
  libzmq - Zero MQ 
    latest release from: http://www.zeromq.org/intro:get-the-software
    v2.2.0 used to build code in this directory
  libfastbit - FastBit (ibis)
    latest release from: https://codeforge.lbl.gov/frs/?group_id=44
    v1.3.5 used to build code in this directory

 Expected source files include:

  packet64.proto   (for non-default 64bit)
  packet.proto
  fastbit.hpp
  scripts.hpp
  server.cpp


 As an alternative to the "COMPILE WITH:" instructions above, use the
 included Makefile by running `make'. To compile only the protocol buffer,
 run `make proto.pb.cc'. To compile only the server, run `make server'. Running
 `make clean' removes previous build of the software.

 The server defaults to ZMQ_PUB on port 7211. 


 BINARY USAGE (for SmartOS):

  server_release [-h] [-p NUMBER] [-v] [-vlite]

    -h          prints help/usage page
    -p PORT     run on port PORT
    -v          runs in verbose mode (print all queries and ZMQ packets)
    -vlite      print time (and dtrace ticks (tick-4999)) for each sent message
    -d DELAY    wait DELAY<1000 ms instead of default 1000
    -q          quiet mode, prints diagnostic information and does not send messages
